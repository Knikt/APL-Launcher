# Compatibility

What works today, what works with limits, what has not been tested on a real screen yet, and what is not possible.
Every "Works" below was checked on a real screen, not only in the PC preview: on the M8 unless the notes say otherwise.

This list follows what users report. To add your screen, open an issue with its model and Tizen version (*Settings › Support › About This TV*) and what works or not.

| | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ | Works, checked on a real screen |
| ⚠️ | Works, with the limits given in the notes |
| 🧪 | Built, but not yet checked on a real screen |
| ❌ | Not possible on these screens |

## Screens

| Screen | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Samsung Smart Monitor M8, Tizen 9 | ✅ | Developed and used every day on this screen, rooted with Vetro, installed with APL Launcher Setup. |
| Samsung The Frame 2025 (TQ43LS03FAUXXC, 43", Tizen 9) | ⚠️ | Reported by a contributor. **Launcher package** (Apps2Samsung): Home and a full start open the launcher, and it comes back after sleep and after Art Mode. **Full package** (launcher and APL Overlay): works; since 1.0.9 APL Overlay reaches Vetro on this screen, the launcher is back about half a second after a wake, and Art Mode is never closed. *Start on APL Launcher* shows the launcher right after power-on. Home twice, Home held and ⏯ do nothing yet on this screen. |
| Samsung The Frame 2022 (LS03B, 55", Tizen 6.5) | ⚠️ | Reported in the issues (#21), 1.0.12 with Vetro: the launcher runs, but the screen settings that go through Vetro (picture, Wi-Fi) show nothing, Bluetooth speakers are found but don't connect, and Prime Video, Samsung TV Plus and Apple TV are missing from the app list. Its diagnostic shows that the screen exposes its settings: APL Overlay and the bridge of the full package are .NET apps for Tizen 7 and newer and most likely don't run, and the launcher reaches Vetro through that bridge. Since 1.0.15 APL Launcher Setup installs the launcher alone on Tizen 6 (its own web bridge, no APL Overlay), and the three apps are listed. Not confirmed on this screen yet. |
| Samsung QN92D (2024, Tizen 8) | ⚠️ | Reported by a contributor, with the full package (Apps2Samsung): the launcher, its bridge and the start-up service work, and the launcher opens about 80 s after a full start. Nothing else reported yet. |
| Samsung AU7700 (2021, Tizen 6) | 🧪 | Asked about in the issues, not tried yet. This model is not in Vetro's compatibility list yet, so root itself is not confirmed. If Vetro works, the launcher alone is the realistic part: APL Overlay is only reported on Tizen 8 and 9. |
| Screens on Tizen 6.x | ⚠️ | Reported on Reddit: no apps on the Home Screen before 1.0.9 (the browser engine ignored a CSS property and every icon was 0×0), all of them showing after a fix. On Tizen 6.0, a few items touch (for example the clock and the profile picture), since its engine also lacks spacing in rows. |
| Other Samsung Smart Monitors and TVs | 🧪 | Not tested yet. They need Vetro, so only screens that Vetro supports can work. Reports are welcome in the issues. |
| Samsung screens without root / Vetro | ❌ | The launcher needs Vetro for the Home button, the remote buttons and the system controls. |

### Reports without a model yet

| Report | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| A 4K TV (Reddit) | ⚠️ | Works, and an automatic update arrived while it was in use. Its three points are fixed: the resolution shown as 1920×1080 and Stremio's cards slowing the animation (1.0.4), only one HDMI input in Sources (1.0.5). Several HDMI inputs not confirmed on it yet. |
| A TV (Reddit) | ⚠️ | No return to the launcher after standby, and Samsung's home not caught: reported before 1.0.4 and without APL Overlay. |
| A TV (Reddit) | ⚠️ | Setup refused a valid Tizen Studio certificate (fixed in 1.0.7), then the launcher stayed black with no apps: most likely the Tizen 6.x problem fixed in 1.0.9. |

## Remotes

| Remote | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Samsung Smart Remote (*Smart Control 2016*), paired over Bluetooth | ✅ | Every button, the microphone included. |
| The same remote, infrared only | ⚠️ | Every button except the microphone: by infrared it only asks the screen to show the pairing guide. |
| Other remotes and keyboards | 🧪 | Not tested. |

Vetro intercepts one device at a time: pick the remote in Vetro › Remapper (see [Installation](installation.md)).

## PC

| | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Windows 11 | ✅ | APL Launcher Setup. |
| Windows 10 | 🧪 | Should work the same; not tested. |
| macOS, Linux | ⚠️ | APL Launcher Setup is a Windows app. Without it, the `.wgt` packages of each release install with Apps2Samsung, but Optimize and Restore are not available. The PC preview (`launcher/index.html`) opens in any browser. |

| Hot Player | ⚠️ | Hot Player keeps only the episode number, never the series or channel name. |
| Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, YouTube, Crunchyroll… | ❌ | They keep nothing readable on the screen and have no public API for your history. The Top Shelf shows what is popular instead. |

### Remote buttons

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Home: back to the launcher | ✅ | In the first minute after a full start, before Vetro takes the key, Home opens Samsung's home for a moment and APL Overlay brings the launcher back (1.0.10). |
| Home twice: App Switcher | ✅ | |
| Hold Home, or ⏯: Control Center, even over a video | ✅ | ⏯ no longer pauses videos. |
| Samsung TV Plus → AquaPlay, Prime Video → TizenTube | ✅ | Only when those apps are installed; otherwise the buttons keep their Samsung role. |
| A stuck key released by itself | ⚠️ | Seen working with the infrared remote; not yet seen over Bluetooth. |

### Control Center and Settings

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Control Center on the launcher and over any app | ✅ | Over apps it is drawn by APL Overlay. |
| Sleep, Wi-Fi, Do Not Disturb, Sleep Timer, Brightness | ✅ | |
| Audio output and Bluetooth headphones (AirPods…) | ✅ | |
| Settings covering every Samsung settings page | ✅ | Real picture controls (backlight, contrast, sharpness, colour, local dimming); a few pages open Samsung's own settings. |
| Sources: inputs and the device on each | ✅ | The HDMI inputs are read from the screen through Vetro (Tizen 9 no longer lists them). Checked on the M8 (one HDMI and USB-C); a screen with several HDMI inputs is not checked yet. |
| An input as a tile on the Home Screen | ✅ | Sources › hold OK on the input › Add to Home Screen. |

### Voice

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Alexa on the microphone button | ✅ | With the remote paired over Bluetooth, after signing in to Amazon once. |
| Siri-like glow while you speak | ✅ | |
| Alexa+ | ❌ | Samsung's Alexa app on this screen is the classic Alexa. |

| An Echo opening apps on the screen | 🧪 | Built; not yet tried with a real Echo. |
| Bixby | ✅ | Turned off by Optimize, and back with Restore. |

### Screen saver

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Apple's aerial videos in 4K | ✅ | 3840×2160 HEVC on the screen's video plane; 1080p if a 4K video is refused. |
| Cross-fade between two 4K videos | 🧪 | The screen decodes one 4K video at a time: the old one holds its last picture during the fade. Not seen yet. |
| Apple's newest aerials | ❌ | Published only in a format the screen refuses. They are left out of the list. |

### System

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Apps left 10 minutes in the background close by themselves | ✅ | Never the app in front, the launcher, the TV inputs, AirPlay or The Frame's Art Mode. Samsung's apps that open by themselves and were never used close after 1 minute; one the screen starts again right away (its preloaded Netflix and YouTube engine) is left alone. |
| Optimize and Restore | ✅ | Checked on the screen with the scripts; the new app runs the same scripts. |
| Back to the launcher after standby | ✅ | The M8 comes back on it by itself. The Frame comes back on the TV input: since 1.0.4 the launcher brings itself back, also when leaving Art Mode (contributor's report). |
| Full restart (`reboot`) | ✅ | The launcher is back after about a minute; about 80 s on The Frame and the QN92D, where Tizen starts it later. |
| Start on APL Launcher | ✅ | *Settings › General & Privacy*: the screen makes the launcher its home app and shows it about a second after power-on (1.3 s on the M8, measured over two restarts; also on The Frame). Since 1.0.14 a wake from standby no longer opens Samsung's home: on the M8 it goes back to the app that was in front, and Home pressed in the minute after a wake (while Vetro restarts) shows Samsung's home for about half a second only. Turning it off, or Restore, puts the original values back; uninstalling the launcher gives the screen its own home back too. |
| Power cut, or a device switched on on HDMI at start-up | 🧪 | Not tested. |
| Automatic updates from GitHub | ✅ | Seen on the M8 and on a user's TV. A new version of the package itself (APL Overlay, the bridge) still needs installing again. The automatic rollback has not been needed yet. |
| TizenBrew and TizenTube | ✅ | Not needed; the launcher opens them and leaves them alone. |
| Casting YouTube from a phone | 🧪 | Not tested since Samsung's YouTube app was removed on the test screen. |
| Steam Link and Moonlight | ✅ | Shown with their own artwork when they are installed. The installer does not install them. |
| Android apps (APK) | ❌ | Tizen cannot run them. |
