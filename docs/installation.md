# Installation

This guide installs APL Launcher on a Samsung Tizen TV or Smart Monitor from a Windows PC, and makes it replace Samsung's home screen.

APL Launcher Setup starts with **Your TV**: Samsung, LG or Android TV, and whether the TV is rooted. Then its **Install** page is the one for that TV. This guide covers Samsung first; [LG (webOS)](#lg-webos) and [Android TV](#android-tv-and-google-tv) are at the end.

## 1. Before you start

**On the PC**
- Windows 10 or 11, on the same network as the screen.
- [Tizen Studio](https://developer.tizen.org/development/tizen-studio/download) with the **CLI**. In the Package Manager, add **Samsung Certificate Extension** under *Extension SDK*.
- A **Samsung certificate** (author + distributor) made for your screen. Create it in Tizen Studio's *Certificate Manager*, or with a tool such as Apps2Samsung. The installer looks for it in both places. Keep a copy somewhere safe: updates must be signed with the same certificate, or the screen refuses them.

**On the screen**
- **Developer Mode**: open *Apps*, type `1 2 3 4 5` on the remote, turn Developer Mode on, enter the PC's IP address, then restart the screen.
- **Vetro** *(required)*: [Vetro](https://github.com/andrearicci93/vetro) runs on the screen with root access. Install it **first**, with Vetro's own guide (the screen has to be rooted). It gives the launcher the Home button and the other remote buttons, APL Overlay, the optimizer, real picture settings, Bluetooth audio, Alexa, faster closing of Samsung's home and app removal. Check that its dashboard opens on the PC at `http://<screen-ip>:8099` before going on. A Vetro built with another port (`VETRO_PORT=…`) works too: APL Launcher Setup also tries the usual other ports (8098, 8100, 9000…), and on the screen the launcher and APL Overlay find it on any port.

> Vetro and TizenBrew need the screen's *Host PC IP* to be `127.0.0.1`, which means the PC can no longer install over Developer Mode. The installer detects Vetro and installs through it instead. **If you use TizenBrew or Vetro, never change Host PC IP back to the PC's address.**

## 2. Install

1. Download **APL Launcher Setup** (`APL-Launcher-Setup.exe`) from the [latest release](https://github.com/Knikt/APL-Launcher/releases/latest) and open it. Windows may say the app is not signed: *More info › Run anyway*. It needs nothing else to run.
2. On the **Install** page:
   - the app finds the screen with **Find**, or type its IP address (*Settings › Connection › Network › Network Status*); it is remembered for next time, and the app checks that Vetro answers;
   - it checks the PC: Tizen Studio and `sdb`, a Samsung certificate;
   - enter the optional API keys and personal websites (see below).
3. Click **Install**. The app:
   - prepares the profile avatars (see below);
   - finds your Samsung certificate and builds a signed package;
   - installs the launcher and APL Overlay through Vetro, and opens the launcher.

Nothing else is installed on the screen. Vetro is required: **Install** stays off until the screen answers.

Your keys and websites stay on your PC (`%APPDATA%\APL-Launcher\keys.local.js`) and are never uploaded to GitHub.

### No Windows PC: install through Vetro with Python

The Python installer works on macOS, Linux, and Windows with Python 3. It installs the full release package directly through Vetro without changing Developer Mode's **Host PC IP** (keep it at `127.0.0.1`) or using TV-Store. By default, use a WGT already signed with a Partner certificate accepted by your TV. To privately enter API keys and websites during installation, use `--configure`: it prompts for keys without echoing them, adds the values to a temporary local package, signs that package with Apps2Samsung CLI, then installs it. Settings are not saved in a local keys file; the resulting installed package contains them on the TV. Do not paste certificate passwords into the terminal.

1. Download `apl-launcher-full-vX.Y.Z.wgt` from the [latest release](https://github.com/Knikt/APL-Launcher/releases/latest). This release is signed with the Tizen SDK's default certificate, so it must be Partner-signed for your TV before installation. Either sign it separately with `apps2samsung-cli sign apl-launcher-full-vX.Y.Z.wgt -o apl-launcher-full-signed.wgt --duids <TV-DUID> --partner`, or let the installer sign it as part of `--configure` (requires the Apps2Samsung CLI and the TV's DUID). If you do not know the DUID, `apps2samsung-cli cert --tv <screen-ip>` lists DUIDs already covered by local certificates; with Host PC IP `127.0.0.1`, the CLI may not be able to query the TV itself.
2. Confirm Vetro is running and note the port used by its dashboard. The default is `8099`; if it differs, pass `--vetro-port <port>`.
3. From a downloaded or cloned repository, run `python3 scripts/install-via-vetro.py <screen-ip> /path/to/apl-launcher-full.wgt`. To enter the API keys and personal websites, add `--configure --duid <TV-DUID>`; if Apps2Samsung CLI is not on PATH, also pass `--apps2samsung-cli /path/to/apps2samsung-cli`. The script verifies Vetro connectivity and the file-transfer checksum, installs the hybrid package, confirms both launcher and overlay are registered, and launches it. Add `--no-launch` to skip launching.
4. Follow steps 3 onward below to configure remote buttons and set up the launcher. Without keys, everything works except trending films and series in the Top Shelf.

The installer sends the package to Vetro over the local network using bounded base64 chunks and removes its temporary files from the TV after installation. It does not print API keys or save them to disk outside its temporary package, which is deleted when the script exits. Tizen 6.x screens need their own two packages instead, as described below.

### Alternative: Apps2Samsung or TV-Store

Every release also has the whole package as `apl-launcher-full-vX.Y.Z.wgt`, for [Apps2Samsung](https://github.com/Apps2Samsung/Apps2Samsung): the launcher, APL Overlay, the bridge to Vetro and the start-up service, in one hybrid package. It is signed with the Tizen SDK's default certificate, and Apps2Samsung re-signs it for your screen. Vetro is still required.

1. Install `apl-launcher-full-vX.Y.Z.wgt` from the [latest release](https://github.com/Knikt/APL-Launcher/releases/latest) in Apps2Samsung as a custom `.wgt` (or send it to TV-Store at `http://<screen-ip>:8077/upload`). Installed this way, the package has no API keys: everything works without them except trending films and series in the Top Shelf.
2. If the launcher is already installed with another certificate, uninstall it first: the screen refuses a package signed with a different certificate.
3. Open APL Launcher from the screen's apps, then *Settings › Remote and Devices › Set Up the Remote Buttons*. It sends Home and ⏯ to APL Overlay in Vetro (Samsung TV Plus and Prime Video too when AquaPlay and TizenTube are installed), as APL Launcher Setup does. Vetro's own app list hides APL Overlay, an app without an icon, so this is the way to pick it from a phone.
4. If the launcher says one step is left: open `http://<screen-ip>:8099` on the phone, then **Remapper**, choose your remote (*Smart Control* when it is paired over Bluetooth, *rc device* by infrared) and turn on **Remote interception**.

After a full restart, the screen comes back on its last input or on Smart Hub; the start-up service puts the launcher on screen about 80 s after power-on. No personal websites, Memoji or SF Pro fonts in this package. Automatic updates work the same way. (`apl-launcher-vX.Y.Z.wgt`, next to it, is the launcher alone, without the overlay.)

**Tizen 6.x screens**: in the full package, opening the launcher starts APL Overlay instead. From 1.1.0, every release has two packages for each Tizen 6 version: `apl-launcher-tizen65-vX.Y.Z.wgt` and `apl-overlay-tizen65-vX.Y.Z.tpk` for Tizen 6.5 (2022 screens), `apl-launcher-tizen60-vX.Y.Z.wgt` and `apl-overlay-tizen60-vX.Y.Z.tpk` for Tizen 6.0 (2021 screens). The `.wgt` is the launcher with its bridge to Vetro and the start-up service, the `.tpk` is APL Overlay in a package of its own (`apl.launcher.overlay`). APL Launcher Setup picks the right pair by itself. With Apps2Samsung, install the `.wgt` as a custom `.wgt`, then the `.tpk` with its command line (the app's custom install takes `.wgt` files only): `apps2samsung-cli install apl-overlay-tizen65-vX.Y.Z.tpk --tv <screen-ip>`. Both files are unsigned: Apps2Samsung signs them for your screen. Then *Set Up the Remote Buttons* as above. Without the `.tpk`, the launcher works on its own and Home goes to APL Launcher; the *Tizen 6* variant of APL Launcher in Apps2Samsung's catalog is that too, `apl-launcher-vX.Y.Z.wgt`, the launcher alone with a web bridge.

### Optional API keys

| Key | What it adds | Where to get it |
|---|---|---|
| TMDB API Key (v3 auth) | Live Top Shelf: trending films and series for each streaming service | [TMDB API settings](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) — use the **API Key (v3 auth)**, not the API Read Access Token |
| YouTube Data API v3 key | Trending videos in TizenTube's Top Shelf | In [Google Cloud Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials), create a project, enable [YouTube Data API v3](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/youtube.googleapis.com), then create an API key |
| Fanart.tv API key | Textless HD backgrounds | [Fanart.tv API key](https://fanart.tv/get-an-api-key/) — copy it from your account profile |

Without keys, everything else still works: logos, App Store icons and backgrounds, music charts.

### Personal websites

The **Install** page can add websites as apps (name and address). They open in Samsung Internet, and are stored in your local keys file only.

### Profile avatars (Memoji)

The installer downloads 58 Memoji faces once from [wimell/tapback-memojis](https://github.com/wimell/tapback-memojis) and puts them in the package, so they work offline. They stay on your PC (`%APPDATA%\APL-Launcher\memoji`) and are never uploaded to this repository. Without a network, profiles use the bundled 3D avatars instead.

To use **your own Memoji**, put PNG images in the `APL Launcher avatars` folder inside your *Pictures* folder, then install again. They come first in the avatar list. On an iPhone: send your Memoji sticker in Messages, open it, then *Share › Save Image*.

**Tizen 6.x screens** (The Frame 2022, for example): from 1.1.0, APL Launcher Setup reads whether the screen runs Tizen 6.0 or 6.5 and installs the two packages made for it, both signed with your certificate and the launcher with your keys: the launcher with its bridge to Vetro and the start-up service, then APL Overlay in a package of its own (`apl.launcher.overlay`), which gets Home and ⏯ like on newer screens. On Tizen 6 the launcher doesn't open when APL Overlay is in its package, hence the two. If APL Overlay can't be installed, the launcher works on its own (the Home Screen, Home, Sources and the settings, but not the Control Center over videos or Alexa on the microphone). Before 1.1.0, or when Setup can't tell 6.0 from 6.5, it installs the launcher alone, with a web bridge.

## 3. Replace Samsung's home screen

The app shows these last two steps when the installation is done.

**Start on APL Launcher.** On the screen, open *Settings › All Settings › Advanced Features* (or *General*, depending on the model):
- **Autorun Smart Hub** → Off
- **Autorun last app** → On

Then put the screen to sleep from the launcher (*Control Center › Sleep*). It starts on the launcher next time.

Screens without *Autorun last app* (The Frame 2025, for example): in APL Launcher, open *Settings › General & Privacy* and turn on **Start on APL Launcher** (needs Vetro). The screen then makes APL Launcher its home app and opens it about a second after power-on, instead of the TV input. While the screen sleeps, APL Overlay turns Autorun Smart Hub off, and puts it back on once the screen is awake: a wake then goes back to the app you were watching instead of opening Samsung's home, and a full start still shows the launcher right away (screens that really come back from standby, like the M8; not The Frame's deep standby). Turning it off puts back the screen's previous home app and Autorun setting. Turn it off before uninstalling APL Launcher: uninstalling with it on also hands the home role back, but to Samsung's home with Autorun left on.

**Home button → APL Launcher** (needs Vetro). Open the Vetro dashboard at `http://<screen-ip>:8099` on the PC, then in **Remapper**:
1. In the device list, choose your remote: **Smart Control 2016** when it is paired over Bluetooth (needed for Alexa), **wt61p807 rc device** when it works by infrared only. To pair it, point it at the screen and hold **Back** and **⏯** together for 3 seconds.
2. *Listen for a key* → press **Home** on the remote. Action: *open an app* → **APL Launcher** (`APLauncher.Home`) → **Save**.
3. Turn on **Remote interception** (called *filter* mode in older Vetro versions), so Home no longer reaches Smart Hub.
4. Make sure Vetro's own *Launcher (Beta)* is off.
5. Click **Done — set up the buttons** in the app: it moves Home to APL Overlay and adds ⏯ (Control Center). When AquaPlay or TizenTube is installed, Samsung TV Plus opens AquaPlay and Prime Video opens TizenTube; otherwise those buttons keep their Samsung role.

Then press Home twice for the app switcher, and hold Home or press ⏯ for the Control Center.

After a **full restart** (unplugged, or a reboot), Vetro needs up to two minutes to start and take over the remote. Until then, Home opens Samsung's home. Putting the screen to sleep and waking it does not have this delay.

Samsung's home (`com.samsung.tv.csfs`) is **not deleted**. It handles sources, quick settings and some menus behind the scenes, so it stays installed and is only closed in the background to free memory.

## 4. Optional: optimize

Open the **Optimize** page. It reads the screen and lists:
- every downloaded app it would **uninstall**, each with its own checkbox;
- every Samsung component it would **silence**;
- the extra changes it would make.

Nothing changes until you click **Optimize** and confirm; a backup is saved first. Details: [optimizer.md](optimizer.md).

## 5. Updates

Updates are automatic: every 6 hours the screen checks this repository's `launcher/version.json`, downloads the new version and restarts when you are on the home screen. You can also check, pause or roll back in *Settings › Support › Launcher update*.

A version that needs new app permissions asks you to install once more with APL Launcher Setup.

## Undo everything

Open the **Restore** page. It:
- removes the Vetro Home rule;
- turns key interception off;
- restores the components, settings and DNS filter changed by the optimizer;
- can uninstall the launcher too (*Also uninstall APL Launcher*).

Then turn **Autorun Smart Hub** back on.

## LG (webOS)

**Rooted TV** (rooted with [WTFBro](https://e.nya.je/getroot/) for example, the Homebrew Channel installed, *SSH Server* on in its settings):

1. In APL Launcher Setup, **Your TV › LG**, *My TV is rooted* on, **Continue**.
2. Type the TV's IP address (or **Find**), the root password (`alpine` unless you changed it), your keys if you have them, then **Install**.
3. The Setup builds the package with your keys, sends it over SSH with Windows' own `ssh.exe` (OpenSSH 8.4 or later: Windows 11, or [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) on Windows 10), installs it with LG's own installer, then puts the [root scripts](../webos/root/README.md) on the TV from the PC: Home opens APL Launcher and the TV starts on it, the picture settings, closing apps, Guide = Control Center, the debloat (a switch), and the TV's software updates blocked. About 10 seconds on an OLED G5.

Without a PC: add `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Knikt/APL-Launcher/main/webos/repo/apps.json` in the Homebrew Channel (*Settings › Add repository*) and install APL Launcher from its list ([webos/repo](../webos/repo/README.md)); then, for the root features, run once in SSH as root:

```sh
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Knikt/APL-Launcher/main/webos/root/install.sh | sh
```

**Without root**: LG's Developer Mode.

1. On the TV, install **Developer Mode** from LG's app store and sign in with a free [LG developer account](https://webostv.developer.lge.com/develop/getting-started/developer-mode-app). Turn on *Dev Mode Status* (the TV restarts), then *Key Server*.
2. In the Setup, **Your TV › LG**, *My TV is rooted* off. Type the IP address and the **passphrase** the Developer Mode app shows, then **Install**.
3. Open APL Launcher from LG's app list. The first time, LG asks whether it may control the TV: **Allow**. Developer Mode lasts 1000 hours: APL Launcher renews it by itself every day.

Without root, Home keeps opening LG's Home, and there are no picture settings, no closing of apps, no Guide button and no debloat.

## Android TV and Google TV

1. On the TV, *Settings › Device Preferences › About*: press OK seven times on *Build*, then in *Developer options* turn on *USB debugging* or *Network debugging*.
2. In the Setup, **Your TV › Android TV**, **Continue**, type the TV's IP address (with Wireless debugging on Android 11 and later, also its pairing port and code), then **Install**.
3. On the TV, allow debugging from this PC (*Always allow*). The Setup finds `adb` or downloads Google's platform-tools once, installs the `.apk` of the latest release, turns on APL Launcher's remote buttons service (Home opens APL Launcher) and opens it.

Without a PC: the **Downloader** app on the TV, with the code **9890834** (it opens `https://github.com/Knikt/APL-Launcher/releases/latest/download/apl-launcher-android.apk`, always the latest version). More: [android.md](android.md).
