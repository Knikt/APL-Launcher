/* ============================================================
   glass.js — pre-blurred glass for the launcher's chrome.

   The panels used backdrop-filter. On a Tizen set that is the most
   expensive thing on screen: the blur is re-run every time a tile
   scales on focus or a panel slides in. This freezes the backdrop
   once per artwork (a 48x27 copy upscaled to a 480x270 tile, so the
   downscale itself is the blur, enlarged a quarter and a quarter
   brighter), then shows the slice that sits under each surface. Opening a panel, moving focus or changing the
   artwork then only changes background-position: nothing filters,
   and nothing is drawn per frame.

     src()      the frozen backdrop in use ("" when there is none)
     lens(x,y)  the background-position for a stage point
     offset(el) stage rectangle of an element, ignoring transforms
     paint()    re-slice every surface now
     refresh()  re-read the artwork, then paint (debounced)
     setSource(url)  force an artwork (a page that is not the Home
                     Screen, e.g. a fixed backdrop); release() undoes it.
     onChange(fn)    called with the new backdrop ("" when there is
                     none), for a sheet that shows it full-frame.

   Everything is behind body.glass, added here, so the skin can be
   switched off and the old translucent fills come straight back.
