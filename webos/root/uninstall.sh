# APL Launcher on webOS — one-command uninstaller. Lifts every change
# install.sh made: the boot hooks are removed, the live binds on /etc/hosts
# and on the LG service binaries are undone, and the stopped systemd units
# are started back.
#
# Run this in SSH as root:
#   sh /media/developer/apl-debloat/uninstall.sh
#
# A reboot alone would also undo almost everything (the live binds live in
# RAM and the stopped units restart at boot), as long as the boot hooks
# under /var/lib/webosbrew/init.d/ are removed first — which this script does.
